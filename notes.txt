Any way to see if broadcast message event is visible on the pi?
o does a broadcast message go into the event queue?
- Most likely not
- previous test did not print inside foreach
o what does an event queue look like?
- foreach on the event queue returned by assistant.start() processes each event
- event not processed when I did a test broadcast

o What are all the EventTypes?
- is there a type for broadcasts? might be ON_DEVICE_ACTION
